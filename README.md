# Voting Blockchain Application
This is a simple blockchain-based voting application built using Flask, allowing users to cast votes for different candidates. The application utilizes a blockchain to store and secure voting data. Below is an overview of the files and functionalities:

## Files:
app.py: This is the main Python file that contains the Flask application. It defines routes, handles form submissions, and interacts with the blockchain.

templates/: This directory contains HTML templates for different pages in the application.

static/: This directory holds static files such as stylesheets or images.

voting_data.csv: A CSV file used as a data storage mechanism for the blockchain. It contains information about each block in the chain.

## Features:

### Blockchain Implementation:

The application uses a simple blockchain structure to store and validate votes.
Each block in the blockchain contains information such as index, timestamp, candidate name, voter ID, previous hash, and hash.

### Genesis Block:
The blockchain starts with a genesis block containing initial data.

### Voting:
Users can cast votes for candidates by providing their names and voter IDs.
The application ensures that each voter can vote only once.

### Password Protection:
Access to view the voting details is protected by a password (PASSWORD in the code).
Users need to enter the correct password to view the voting details.

### Data Persistence:
The blockchain data is stored in a CSV file (voting_data.csv), allowing data to persist between application runs.
Validation:

### The application performs basic validation, such as checking if the voter ID is numerical and if it has already been used for voting.

## How to Run:

### Clone the repository:

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting-system-v1.1.git

### Run the application:

Copy code

python block chain.py

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

## Note:
Ensure that you replace the placeholder values such as PASSWORD and CSV_FILE_PATH with your actual password and file paths in the code.

This application is meant for educational purposes and may require additional security measures for production use.
